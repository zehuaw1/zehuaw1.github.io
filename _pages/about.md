Hi! I'm Zehua Wang, an undergraduate student pursuing a B.S. in Physics / Artificial Intelligence and Decision Making at MIT.

## Academic Background

My academic journey has been rooted in both theoretical physics and computational research. I achieved **1st place in the theoretical round** at the 54th International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) and earned gold medals at multiple prestigious competitions, including 3rd place globally at the Romanian Master of Physics.

I completed my freshman year at Tsinghua University's Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS) (GPA: 3.95/4.00) before joining MIT, where I am maintaining a 5.00/5.00 GPA.

## Research & Projects

I'm passionate about the intersection of artificial intelligence, physics, and robotics. I currently work in two research groups at MIT:

- **Prof. Tommi Jaakkola's group** — researching diffusion models and molecular dynamics
- **FortyFive AI Lab (Dr. Ge Yang)** — developing RL and imitation learning pipelines for humanoid whole-body control; investigating scaling laws for embodied AI

Previously, I worked with **Prof. Huazhe Xu at Tsinghua** on learning-based robot manipulation (RIR framework, sim-to-real transfer).

Some recent projects:
- **Fast Humanoid Loco-Manipulation via Flow Matching** — FM achieves 820 vs. 280 survival steps over DDPM at 5-NFE; zero-shot loco-manipulation via classifier guidance
- **RL vs. SFT for Math Reasoning** — GMPO matches SFT on GSM8K without step-by-step supervision
- **Enhancing Diffusion Models with RL & Adversarial Rewards** — 21.7% FID reduction, plug-and-play

## Beyond Academics

Outside of my studies, I maintain an active lifestyle and enjoy a variety of sports. Basketball is a particular passion; I had the privilege of leading the IIIS basketball team as an undergraduate during my freshman year. I've also been skiing for over a decade and enjoy playing soccer, volleyball, table tennis, swimming, hiking, etc. In my spare time, I love to unwind by listening to music and sometimes singing them.
